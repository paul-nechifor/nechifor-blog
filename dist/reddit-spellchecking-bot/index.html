It's not so easy to create a list of misspellings since one misspelled word might have multiple corrections. But out of the hundreds of comments every minute, I'm bound to find misspellings even with a short list.</p><p>Some people really get angry when you correct them. I didn't make this to feel better than them. I think it's a good thing when I get corrected. I can't tell how many times I've spelled <em>seams</em> when I meant <em>seems</em> before somebody corrected me. A spell-checker won't tell you that because <em>seams</em> is a real word.</p><p>The Python script simply gets about 100 of the newest comments every 30 seconds and checks if there are any clear-cut misspellings. Every 5 minutes I post the most recent. Since people don't like to be corrected I thought it best to be apologetic so my text was:</p><blockquote><p>I'm terribly sorry, but did you mean “{CORRECT}” instead of “{WRONG}”?</p></blockquote><p>People didn't like the initial comments. So I thought I should be even <em>more</em> apologetic… and also less monotonous. I remembered the <a href="http://www.diveintopython.net/xml_processing/">Kant Generator</a> from my early Python days and created this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1i8gzk/is_nair_a_good_alternative_to_shaving/cb2b7mt">grammar file</a> for it.</p><p>What I learned from this is that the journey of programming the bot (well more of a walk) isn't the interesting part, the responses you get are. I'll split them the traditional way.</p><h2>The Ugly</h2><p>Some people don't believe it's a bot, but rather that I'm a loser with nothing better to do.</p><p>The bot can't detect a user's intentions so it sometimes ends up correcting people when <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1idodh/kanye_wests_new_shirt_is_a_120_plain_white_tshirt/cb3ixvp?context=3">they are joking</a>:</p><blockquote><p>THIS IS NOT THE TIME GODDAMMIT, HE/SHE IS TRYING TO BE WITTY. JESUS FUCK</p></blockquote><p>I didn't check for block quotes, so it was <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1i83fx/computer_collectible_card_games/cb1w2vw?context=3">correcting the wrong people</a>.</p><h2>The Good</h2><blockquote><p>You're adorable. — <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1i8k07/if_you_woke_up_one_day_in_an_insane_asylum_what/cb29so9">time146</a></p></blockquote><!-- --><blockquote><p>awww, so polite and apologetic. what an adorable bot. &lt;3 — <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ibbgy/allie_finished_it_hyperbole_and_a_half_book_comes/cb306go">ekrej</a></p></blockquote><!-- --><blockquote><p>This better become a thing, i want to see you around more. I enjoyed that vey much. — <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i82qt/iama_request_person_who_animates_boob_physics_in/cb20axc">mechanistic6</a></p></blockquote><p>Everybody seems to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/1ibmnq/emsk_how_to_take_out_a_wasp_nest_with_a_cup_of/cb2z5wb?context=2">think I'm Canadian</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Canadian bot?</p></blockquote><h2>The Bad</h2><p>Some people <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i86h0/boyfriend_23m_spends_money_carelessly_considering/cb1xx4k?context=4">really, really hate it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>it's funny that the bot had to correct relevant when the stupid bot itself is never relevant to any post. and prefacing a bot with being sorry, wtf is that about? no, if you were sorry, you wouldn't be here. I'm terribly sorry but here is a bullet in the head. see how that works? just freaking park the thing and chat on reddit like a normal person. or make a circle jerking bot subreddit where everyone's bots jerk to each other.</p></blockquote><p>Body builders <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/comments/1i9p65/mark_wahlberg_project_pain_and_gain/cb2cqbk?context=3">don't like to be told</a> what the correct spelling of <em>dumbbell</em> is.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>All in all, the bot is making way more comments than I could keep up with and it's getting a lot of karma. It took me about 2 years to get as much karma on my first Reddit account as the bot did in 3 days.</p><p>I'm no longer running it now since I want to improve it and put it on GitHub.</p><p>Date: 2013-07-26</p><p>Created by <a href="/">Paul Nechifor</a>.</p></article></body></html>
