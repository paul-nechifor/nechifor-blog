These are also know as TL;RDs on the internets.</p><p>I use the Python bindings for the Open Text Summarizer (OTS). This works by extracting the most important sentences in the text.</p><p>Since such a thing would only work on certain types of comments I verify that they are of sufficient length and only contain plain text (no lists, tables and others).</p><h2>Results</h2><p>The <a href="https://github.com/paul-nechifor/reddit-tldr">source code</a> is available on GitHub and I ran the bot on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/CGTLDR">CGTLDR</a>.</p><p>The results have been incredibly disappointing. The comments made are sometimes useful, but they have produced little interest.</p><p>Date: 2013-08-04</p><p>Created by <a href="/">Paul Nechifor</a>.</p></article></body></html>
