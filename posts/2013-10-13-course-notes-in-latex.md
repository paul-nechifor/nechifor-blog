title: Course notes in Latex
---

Since nothing good (GitHub/Latex) is ever taken in moderation I've decided to experiment with taking notes only in Latex and using GitHub to track the changes. I'm doing this for my Operational Research course ([repo](https://github.com/paul-nechifor/or-notes) and [PDF](https://github.com/paul-nechifor/or-notes/blob/master/or-notes.pdf?raw=true) for the notes).

### Impressions so far

The bad:

*   **Slower to write.** I'm not very fluent in Latex and I have to look up a lot of things.
*   **Harder and slower to draw stuff.** I love TikZ, but OCDing over drawings takes a lot of time.

The good:

*   **Easy to fix something.**
*   **You don't have to repeat yourself** so much when showing the progression of a slowly changing thing.
*   **You can grow the content organically.** You don't have to put knowledge into silos based on where it came from and when you wrote them.
*   **Looks way better.**
