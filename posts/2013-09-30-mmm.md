title: The Mythical Man-Month
---

I read &ldquo;The Mythical Man-Month&rdquo; (a collection of essays on software engineering from 1975) because it was frequently mentioned in &ldquo;Dreaming in Code&rdquo;.

The experiences in it predate the microcomputer revolution and the low entry barrier for programming so what surprises me is how many similarities there are. Tools change but human nature stays the same.

The book talks more about the human factor of programming (which is the difficult part on large systems) and there are few technical details. This makes it popular even for non-CS people and Brooks himself calls it the bible of software engineering. You might think this would be hubris, but what he means is that &ldquo;everybody quotes it, some people read it, and a few people go by it&rdquo;.
