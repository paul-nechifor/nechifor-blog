title: Switching to Sans-serif
---

I'm switching my web site to all sans-serif fonts. While the fonts I use look amazing on Ubuntu in any browser, they're [horrible in Chrome on Windows 7](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=137692). I guess it's more important how others see my web site than me.

In the olden days of the web (when IE6 was popular) fonts were a mess to use. If you wanted to use a pretty font you had to save the specific text as an image. Now that almost every browser supports loading fonts things have gotten better, but they are far from ideal. Since every browser/OS combination can use whatever font rendering it wants it's impossible to get pixel perfect rendering.

I use Ubuntu the most and I think its font rendering is the best. I was spoiled by the luxury of being able to see any font displayed beautifully. Google-hosted serif fonts like [Crimson Text](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Crimson+Text) and [Cardo](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Cardo) look amazing for me, but I can't rely on those knowing that they look horribly jagged for others.

I'm going to use [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) since it doesn't look so bad without anti-aliasing.
