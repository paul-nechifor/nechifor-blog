I think I'm going to start a blog about what I'm working on. A lot of the things I do don't end up being completely finished, so it would be nice to have a place to centralize my work in progress.

I don't plan to talk about myself, only about my work and I&rsquo;m not going to write about everything I've created in the past. I&rsquo;ll start with recent stuff.
